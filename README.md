This repository contains all the codes related to the hackbio internship, which consists of a total of 4 submission tasks. New codes will be added weekly.

For the stage-zero task, we created a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains all the details of our team members - team tyrosine. The details are name, slack username, email, hobby, country, and main background discipline. We printed our variable using a Python f" string, which allows us to include dynamic content by adding our variable inside the braces.   

Stage two assignments had a total of 4 tasks, ranging to different topics from microbiology, plant science, biochemistry and gene expression. The tasks required to analyse different big datasets and visualise results with different plots. All the tasks are done in Colab. I used Pandas with Plotly, Seaborn and SciPy packages.
